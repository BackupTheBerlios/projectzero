Automake/Autoconf todo:
------------------------

- find/write decent code for wxwindows in configure.in (flakarchiver?)
- nicely separate generator en wxwindows program, they now have common libs 
  and cflags
- make install doesn't work yet
- ...

Project Structure todo:
------------------------

- wxwindows resource files system. .rc files do not work in linux. .xpm need to be included directly. use both bmp and xpm?
- fix includes

Programming todo's:
--------------------

- how to convert xmlChar to wxString (with support for utf8/unicode stuff)?
- wxString: use (const char*) or (const wchar_t*)? seems to depend on platform
  wich compile options were used
- filename checking/format
